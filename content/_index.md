# About

Hey! Welcome to my site! My name is Cole. I'm a passionate linux user, baker,
and cooking nerd. I'm also a husband and father of two. That's where I get all
my patience to fix Arch Linux if it breaks and spend hours configuring
software. I'll expand this later but that should suffice for now. Have a look
around and try not to break anything. But, if you do see something broken, it's
definitely supposed to happen that way. Just trust me.
